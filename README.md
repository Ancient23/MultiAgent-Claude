# MultiAgent-Claude

**A multi-agent orchestration framework for Claude Code that maximizes context efficiency through specialized agents, structured memory, and intelligent task delegation.**

## Overview

MultiAgent-Claude provides a collection of prompt engineering templates and initialization scripts that transform Claude Code into a sophisticated multi-agent development environment. Rather than having a single AI assistant handle all tasks, this framework creates specialized agents that research and plan, while the main Claude instance executes implementations based on those plans.

## Quick Start

### Global Installation (Recommended)
```bash
# Install globally via npm
npm install -g multiagent-claude

# Or clone and link for development
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MultiAgent-Claude.git
cd MultiAgent-Claude
npm link
```

### Initialize Your Project
```bash
# Interactive setup with prompts
multiagent-claude init
# or use the short alias
mac init

# You'll be prompted for:
# - Memory system setup
# - GitHub Actions for CI/CD
# - Playwright testing (CLI or web)
```

### Add Features to Existing Projects
```bash
# Add specific features
mac add ci-cd          # GitHub Actions workflows
mac add testing        # CLI testing with Playwright
mac add web-testing    # Web app testing
mac add all            # Everything
```

3. **Invoke specialized agents:**
   ```
   "Use the frontend-ui-expert agent to design a dashboard component"
   "Launch the aws-backend-architect to plan our API structure"
   "Deploy the playwright-test-engineer to create E2E tests"
   ```

## Why Multi-Agent Architecture?

### The Context Window Challenge

LLMs like Claude have a limited context window - the amount of text they can process at once. In complex projects, trying to hold all project knowledge, code, documentation, and current task details in a single context becomes inefficient and eventually impossible. Every token counts, and redundant information wastes valuable context space.

### The Research-Plan-Execute Pattern

Our multi-agent architecture solves this through separation of concerns:

1. **Specialized Research Agents** 
   - Load only the context needed for their specific domain
   - Use MCP tools to gather information without polluting main context
   - Create detailed, actionable plans saved to disk
   - Return only a file path to the parent agent

2. **Main Execution Agent**
   - Maintains project-wide context and current task focus
   - Reads plans from disk when needed
   - Executes implementations with full codebase access
   - Orchestrates multiple specialized agents

This separation means:
- Research agents can dive deep without worrying about context limits
- The main agent keeps a clean working context
- Plans persist on disk for reference without consuming memory
- Multiple agents can work on different aspects in parallel

### Why Agents Don't Execute Directly

Having agents only create plans rather than directly modifying code provides several critical benefits:

1. **Context Isolation**: Research agents don't need write access to your entire codebase
2. **Verification Layer**: The main agent can review plans before execution
3. **Audit Trail**: All decisions are documented in plan files
4. **Rollback Capability**: Plans can be adjusted without touching code
5. **Parallel Planning**: Multiple agents can create plans simultaneously

## The Memory System

### Structure and Purpose

```
.claude/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ memory/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project.md           # Project-wide conventions and context
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ patterns/            # Successful implementation patterns
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ decisions/           # Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.json          # Quick lookup and statistics
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ context_session_*.md # Current session working memory
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ doc/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [agent]-[task]-*.md  # Agent-generated plans
```

### How Memory Enhances Development

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Successful solutions are saved and reused
2. **Consistency**: Project conventions are maintained across sessions
3. **Decision History**: Architectural choices are documented with rationale
4. **Knowledge Persistence**: Learning survives between conversations
5. **Quick Retrieval**: Index enables fast pattern matching

### Memory Hierarchy

- **Session Context** (`.claude/tasks/`): Immediate task focus
- **Agent Plans** (`.claude/doc/`): Detailed implementation blueprints  
- **Persistent Memory** (`.claude/memory/`): Long-term project knowledge

This tiered approach ensures:
- Fast access to current task information
- Preservation of successful patterns
- Gradual knowledge accumulation
- Reduced repetition of solved problems

## Available Agents

### Core Development Agents
- **ai-agent-architect**: AI systems, LangChain, MCP servers
- **frontend-ui-expert**: React, Next.js, UI components
- **aws-backend-architect**: AWS services, infrastructure design

# Use the specialized agent to create test plans
"Use the playwright-test-engineer agent to create checkout flow tests"

# The agent will:
# 1. Analyze your application
# 2. Create comprehensive test scenarios
# 3. Generate page objects
# 4. Design CI/CD configuration
# 5. Save plan to .claude/doc/playwright-tests-*.md
```

### CI/CD Integration

The repository includes GitHub Actions workflows for automated memory updates and testing.

#### Available Workflows

##### 1. Memory System Updates (`claude-memory-update.yml`)
- **Smart Commit Detection**: Only commits when meaningful changes occur
- **Report Generation**: Creates `latest-report.md` instead of numbered files
- **Pattern Detection**: Learns from commits (only on significant changes)
- **ADR Generation**: Documents architectural decisions from PRs
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks for existing ADRs before creating new ones
- **No Spam Commits**: Filters out timestamp-only changes and redundant reports

##### 2. CLI Testing (`playwright-cli-tests.yml`)
- **Automated Testing**: Runs on push and PRs
- **Sharded Execution**: Parallel test runs for speed (3 shards)
- **Memory Integration**: Documents test patterns (once per day maximum)
- **Report Merging**: Combines sharded test results using blob reporter
- **Artifact Management**: Uses numbered job indices to prevent conflicts
- **Daily Pattern Limit**: Prevents duplicate pattern documentation

##### 3. Web Testing (`playwright-web-tests.yml`)
- **Web App Testing**: Comprehensive browser testing with 4 shards
- **Failure-Only Tracking**: Only saves results when tests fail or are flaky
- **Visual Regression**: Screenshot comparisons with diff detection
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks test duration and flakiness
- **PR Comments**: Automated test result summaries on pull requests
- **Smart Memory Updates**: Skips updates for successful test runs

#### Setup

##### During Initialization
```bash
mac init
# You'll be prompted:
# - Enable GitHub Actions for memory updates? (y/n)
# - Add Playwright testing framework? (y/n)
# - Include CLI tests? (y/n)
# - Include web application tests? (y/n)
```

##### Add to Existing Project
```bash
# Add all CI/CD features
mac add all

# Or add specific features
mac add ci-cd          # Memory system workflows
mac add testing        # CLI testing
mac add web-testing    # Web app testing
```

#### GitHub Actions Permissions

The workflow needs permission to push changes back to your repository. Choose one of these approaches:

**Option 1: Grant Write Permissions (Recommended)**
The workflow already includes the necessary permissions:
```yaml
jobs:
  update-memory:
    permissions:
      contents: write  # Allows pushing to repository
```

**Option 2: Use Personal Access Token (For Protected Branches)**
If you have branch protection rules:

1. Create a Personal Access Token with `repo` scope
2. Add it as a repository secret named `GH_PAT`
3. Update the workflow checkout step:
```yaml
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v3
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
```

**Note**: No additional secrets are needed for basic operation - the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` works with proper permissions.

#### How It Works

##### Memory Updates (Optimized)
1. **Change Detection**: Only runs when files actually change
2. **Smart Reports**: Uses `latest-report.md` instead of numbered files
3. **Conditional Commits**: Skips commits for timestamp-only changes
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Documents patterns only when discovered

##### Test Integration
1. **Daily Patterns**: Documents test patterns once per day
2. **Failure Focus**: Only saves test results when failures occur
3. **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate pattern files
4. **Clean History**: No redundant commits in git log

#### Preventing Duplicates
The system prevents duplicates through:
- **Content Hashing**: MD5 hash of content (excluding metadata)
- **PR Number Tracking**: ADRs include PR number in metadata
- **Source Tagging**: Clear distinction between manual and CI entries
- **Conflict Strategies**: Configurable merge/replace/keep-both options
