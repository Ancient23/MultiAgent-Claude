# MultiAgent-Claude

**A multi-agent orchestration framework for Claude Code that maximizes context efficiency through specialized agents, structured memory, and intelligent task delegation.**

## Overview

MultiAgent-Claude provides a collection of prompt engineering templates and initialization scripts that transform Claude Code into a sophisticated multi-agent development environment. Rather than having a single AI assistant handle all tasks, this framework creates specialized agents that research and plan, while the main Claude instance executes implementations based on those plans.

## Quick Start

1. **Initialize the multi-agent environment:**
   - Copy the content from `claude-code-init-prompts.md`
   - Paste it into a new Claude Code conversation
   - Claude will analyze your project and set up the agent infrastructure

2. **Add to existing projects:**
   - Use `memory-system-addon-prompt.md` to add just the memory system
   - Use individual agent templates from `Examples/agents/` as needed

3. **Invoke specialized agents:**
   ```
   "Use the frontend-ui-expert agent to design a dashboard component"
   "Launch the aws-backend-architect to plan our API structure"
   ```

## Why Multi-Agent Architecture?

### The Context Window Challenge

LLMs like Claude have a limited context window - the amount of text they can process at once. In complex projects, trying to hold all project knowledge, code, documentation, and current task details in a single context becomes inefficient and eventually impossible. Every token counts, and redundant information wastes valuable context space.

### The Research-Plan-Execute Pattern

Our multi-agent architecture solves this through separation of concerns:

1. **Specialized Research Agents** 
   - Load only the context needed for their specific domain
   - Use MCP tools to gather information without polluting main context
   - Create detailed, actionable plans saved to disk
   - Return only a file path to the parent agent

2. **Main Execution Agent**
   - Maintains project-wide context and current task focus
   - Reads plans from disk when needed
   - Executes implementations with full codebase access
   - Orchestrates multiple specialized agents

This separation means:
- Research agents can dive deep without worrying about context limits
- The main agent keeps a clean working context
- Plans persist on disk for reference without consuming memory
- Multiple agents can work on different aspects in parallel

### Why Agents Don't Execute Directly

Having agents only create plans rather than directly modifying code provides several critical benefits:

1. **Context Isolation**: Research agents don't need write access to your entire codebase
2. **Verification Layer**: The main agent can review plans before execution
3. **Audit Trail**: All decisions are documented in plan files
4. **Rollback Capability**: Plans can be adjusted without touching code
5. **Parallel Planning**: Multiple agents can create plans simultaneously

## The Memory System

### Structure and Purpose

```
.claude/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ memory/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project.md           # Project-wide conventions and context
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ patterns/            # Successful implementation patterns
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ decisions/           # Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.json          # Quick lookup and statistics
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ context_session_*.md # Current session working memory
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ doc/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [agent]-[task]-*.md  # Agent-generated plans
```

### How Memory Enhances Development

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Successful solutions are saved and reused
2. **Consistency**: Project conventions are maintained across sessions
3. **Decision History**: Architectural choices are documented with rationale
4. **Knowledge Persistence**: Learning survives between conversations
5. **Quick Retrieval**: Index enables fast pattern matching

### Memory Hierarchy

- **Session Context** (`.claude/tasks/`): Immediate task focus
- **Agent Plans** (`.claude/doc/`): Detailed implementation blueprints  
- **Persistent Memory** (`.claude/memory/`): Long-term project knowledge

This tiered approach ensures:
- Fast access to current task information
- Preservation of successful patterns
- Gradual knowledge accumulation
- Reduced repetition of solved problems

## Available Agents

### Core Development Agents
- **ai-agent-architect**: AI systems, LangChain, MCP servers
- **frontend-ui-expert**: React, Next.js, UI components

### CI/CD Integration

The repository includes optional GitHub Actions workflow for automated memory updates.

#### Features
- **Automatic Pattern Detection**: Learns from your commits with deduplication
- **ADR Generation**: Creates architectural decisions from Pull Requests
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Content-based hashing prevents duplicate entries
- **Source Tracking**: All CI-generated files tagged with metadata headers
- **Conflict Resolution**: Smart merging strategies for manual vs automated updates

#### Setup
Enable during initialization:
```bash
multiagent-claude setup
# Answer "y" when asked about GitHub Actions
```

Or add to existing project:
```bash
# Copy workflow manually
cp node_modules/multiagent-claude/.github/workflows/claude-memory-update.yml .github/workflows/
```

#### How It Works
1. **On Every Commit**: Analyzes changes for patterns
2. **On PR Merge**: Creates ADR with decision rationale
3. **Deduplication**: Checks content hash before creating entries
4. **Metadata Headers**: Tags all entries with source (manual/CI)

#### Preventing Duplicates
The system prevents duplicates through:
- **Content Hashing**: MD5 hash of content (excluding metadata)
- **PR Number Tracking**: ADRs include PR number in metadata
- **Source Tagging**: Clear distinction between manual and CI entries
- **Conflict Strategies**: Configurable merge/replace/keep-both options

Example metadata header:
```markdown
---
source: github-action
created_by: ci
created_at: 2024-08-19T10:00:00Z
related_pr: 123
related_commit: abc123def
version: 1.0
---
```
