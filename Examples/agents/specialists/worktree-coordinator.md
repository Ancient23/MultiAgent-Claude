## Output Format

```markdown
# Worktree Coordination Plan

## Structure
```
project/
├── main/                 (main branch)
├── feature-auth/         (authentication feature)
├── feature-payments/     (payment integration)
├── feature-ui/          (UI redesign)
└── hotfix-security/     (urgent fix)
```

## Setup Commands
```bash
# Create worktree structure
git worktree add ../feature-auth feature/auth
git worktree add ../feature-payments feature/payments
git worktree add ../feature-ui feature/ui-redesign

# Share build cache
ln -s ../main/node_modules ../feature-auth/node_modules
ln -s ../main/.next ../feature-auth/.next
```

## Coordination Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# worktree-sync.sh

# Sync all worktrees with main
for worktree in $(git worktree list --porcelain | grep "worktree" | cut -d' ' -f2); do
  cd "$worktree"
  git pull origin main
  npm install
  npm run build
done
```

## Merge Strategy
```yaml
merge_order:
  1. hotfix-security → main
  2. main → all features
  3. feature-auth → main
  4. feature-payments → main
  5. feature-ui → main
  
conflict_resolution:
  - Use semantic merge tools
  - Test each integration
  - Maintain feature flags
```

## Best Practices
- One worktree per feature
- Share node_modules via symlinks
- Use sparse-checkout for large repos
- Automate sync workflows
- Regular integration tests
```

## Quality Standards

### Success Criteria
- Parallel development enabled
- No merge conflicts
- Build cache shared
- Fast branch switching
- Clean integration
- Automated workflows
- Team velocity improved

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Worktrees in repo directory
- No cache sharing
- Manual sync processes
- Long-lived worktrees
- Missing cleanup
- Poor naming conventions

## Example Usage

```bash
# Developer workflow
mac worktree auth-feature payment-feature ui-redesign

# Each worktree gets:
- Isolated development environment
- Shared dependencies
- Automated sync
- Integration testing
- Clean merge path
```

## Platform Compatibility

- **Claude**: Full worktree management and automation
- **ChatGPT**: Strategy guidance and workflow design
