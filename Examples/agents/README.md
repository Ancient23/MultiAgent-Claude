# Agent Templates

MultiAgent-Claude distinguishes between **orchestrators** that coordinate work and **specialists** that provide deep domain plans. All agents operate in a research-only mode and output implementation plans to `.claude/doc/`. For OpenAI platforms, each specialist also has a corresponding role file in `.chatgpt/roles`.

## Orchestrators

| `fullstack-feature-orchestrator` | Manages end‑to‑end feature delivery across frontend and backend | `fullstack feature`, `frontend + backend` |
| `infrastructure-migration-architect` | Plans large‑scale infrastructure transitions | `infrastructure migration`, `re‑architecture` |
| `issue-triage-orchestrator` | Leads systematic bug investigation and resolution | `bug triage`, `performance issue` |
