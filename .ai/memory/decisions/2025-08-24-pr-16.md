# ADR: test: add Playwright CLI coverage and mobile placeholders

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Pull Request #16 merged on 2025-08-24

## Decision
## Summary

- decouple visual spec from localhost and skip when dev server absent

## Testing
- 
> multiagent-claude@2.0.0 test:cli
> playwright test --project=cli-tests
