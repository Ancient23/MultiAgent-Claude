# ADR-003: Memory System Architecture

**Date**: 2025-08-19  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Source**: Memory system design analysis

## Context

The MultiAgent-Claude framework requires a persistent memory system to:
1. Preserve knowledge and patterns across sessions
2. Enable pattern reuse and consistency
3. Document architectural decisions and their rationale
4. Provide quick access to project-specific information
5. Support learning and continuous improvement

Traditional approaches either lose knowledge between sessions or create excessive context overhead.

## Decision

We implement a **Hierarchical File-Based Memory System** with:

1. **Tiered Memory Structure**: Session context → Agent plans → Persistent memory
2. **Pattern Library**: Documented successful implementation patterns
3. **Decision Records**: Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for major choices
4. **Project Context**: Consolidated project-wide knowledge
5. **Knowledge Index**: Fast lookup and statistics

## Rationale

### Persistence Benefits
- Knowledge survives between Claude Code sessions
- Patterns can be reused across similar tasks
- Decisions are documented with full context
- Learning accumulates over time

### Hierarchical Access
- Session context provides immediate task focus
- Agent plans contain detailed implementation blueprints
- Persistent memory stores long-term knowledge
- Index enables fast retrieval without full scanning

### File-Based Storage
- Human-readable Markdown format
- Version control friendly
- Easy to backup and transfer
- No external dependencies

### Structured Organization
- Clear separation of different knowledge types
- Consistent naming and formatting
- Searchable content organization
- Scalable growth pattern

### Memory Types

**Session Memory** (`.claude/tasks/`):
- Current session context and objectives
- Immediate task focus and requirements
- Temporary working information
- Links to relevant persistent memory

**Implementation Plans** (`.claude/doc/`):
- Agent-generated detailed plans
- Specific implementation instructions
- Success criteria and validation steps
- Rollback procedures and error handling

**Pattern Library** (`.claude/memory/patterns/`):
- Proven successful implementation approaches
- Reusable code templates and structures
- Best practice documentation
- Anti-pattern identification and avoidance

**Decision Records** (`.claude/memory/decisions/`):
- Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
- Decision rationale and context
- Consequences and trade-offs
- Review schedules and outcomes

**Project Knowledge** (`.claude/memory/project.md`):
- Project overview and context
- Technology stack and conventions
- Key architectural principles
- Development workflow and standards

### Content Standards

**Pattern Documentation Format**:
```markdown
# Pattern: [Name]
## Context
[When this pattern applies]

## Implementation
[Code or process example]

## Benefits
[Why this pattern works]

## Usage Count
[How often successfully used]
```

**ADR Format**:
```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Status**: [Proposed|Accepted|Deprecated|Superseded]

## Context
[Situation and problem]

## Decision
[What was decided]

## Rationale
[Why this decision was made]

## Consequences
[Positive, negative, and neutral outcomes]
```

### Index Management

**Index Structure** (`.claude/memory/index.json`):
```json
{
  "last_updated": "timestamp",
  "statistics": {
    "patterns": 15,
    "decisions": 8,
    "documentation_files": 32
  },
  "quick_lookup": {
    "patterns": ["pattern-name": "file-path"],
    "decisions": ["decision-title": "file-path"],
    "documentation": ["topic": "file-path"]
  }
}
```

## Memory Access Patterns

### Agent Memory Integration
1. **Check Session Context**: Read `.claude/tasks/context_session_*.md`
2. **Review Relevant Patterns**: Search `.claude/memory/patterns/`
3. **Reference Decisions**: Check applicable ADRs
4. **Create Implementation Plan**: Save to `.claude/doc/`

### Pattern Creation Workflow
1. **Identify Success**: Recognize successful implementation
2. **Document Pattern**: Create pattern file with context
3. **Update Index**: Add to quick lookup
4. **Reference Count**: Track usage for validation

### Decision Documentation
1. **Capture Context**: Document decision situation
2. **Record Rationale**: Explain why decision was made
3. **Note Consequences**: Document expected outcomes
4. **Schedule Review**: Set review timeline

## Quality Standards
