# ADR: Ci compatible visual playwright

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Pull Request #22 merged on 2025-08-25

## Decision
This pull request introduces major improvements to the MultiAgent-Claude frameworkâ€™s prompt engineering and testing infrastructure. The most significant changes are the adoption of a HOP/LOP (Higher Order Prompt / Lower Order Prompt) template system to eliminate prompt redundancy, and the formalization of Playwright as the primary testing framework for CI/CD. These changes are well-documented with new architectural decision records (ADRs), implementation plans, patterns, and updates to the project memory index for traceability and discoverability.

**Prompt Engineering System Improvements:**

* Added a new ADR documenting the decision to implement the HOP/LOP template system for prompt generation, detailing context, rationale, architecture, and migration path. (.ai/memory/decisions/adr-hop-lop-template-system.md)
* Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the HOP/LOP system, specifying directory structure, template features, CLI integration, validation, and extensibility. (.ai/memory/implementation-plans/hop-lop-template-system-plan.md)
* Added a reusable prompt pattern for HOP/LOP, describing its structure, variable system, CLI/Claude commands, benefits, and anti-patterns. (.ai/memory/patterns/prompts/hop-lop-template-pattern.md)

**Testing and Quality Assurance Enhancements:**

* Added an ADR formalizing the adoption of Playwright for CI/CD testing, including rationale for sharding, visual regression, and migration strategy. (.ai/memory/decisions/adr-playwright-testing.md)

**Project Memory and Metadata Updates:**

* Updated the project memory index to track new patterns, decisions, documentation files, and tags for prompt engineering and development tools. (.ai/memory/index.json) [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-ec97575c06138430387eced3433be9595b840541e8be8fe40673668a5932b428L2-R24) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-ec97575c06138430387eced3433be9595b840541e8be8fe40673668a5932b428L32-R37)

These changes collectively reduce prompt redundancy, improve maintainability, accelerate implementation creation, and enhance test reliability and coverage.
