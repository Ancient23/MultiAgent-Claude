# Explicit File Creation Pattern for Init Command

## Pattern Name
Explicit Instructions for Complete File Creation

## Context
The `mac init` command was only creating a subset of queued files (3 out of 11+ expected) because the instructions to Claude were not explicit enough. Claude needs very clear, itemized instructions for each file to create.

## Problem
- Only partial files were being created (e.g., 3 agents instead of 11)
- CLAUDE.md wasn't being updated
- AGENTS.md wasn't being created/merged properly
- Claude was not treating file creation as mandatory

## Solution

### 1. Make Instructions CRITICAL and REQUIRED
```javascript
enhancedPrompt += `**CRITICAL**: You MUST create ALL the files listed below. This is not optional.\n\n`;
```

### 2. Enumerate Each File Explicitly
Instead of general instructions, list each file individually:
```javascript
queuedAgents.forEach((agent, index) => {
  enhancedPrompt += `#### ${index + 1}. CREATE FILE: .claude/agents/${agent}.md\n`;
  enhancedPrompt += `- **REQUIRED**: Save to .claude/agents/${agent}.md\n\n`;
});
```

### 3. Add Verification Counts
Tell Claude exactly how many files to create:
```javascript
enhancedPrompt += `**VERIFICATION**: You must create exactly ${queuedAgents.length} agent files.\n`;
enhancedPrompt += `**VERIFICATION**: You must create exactly ${queuedRoles.length} role files + 2 additional files.\n`;
```

### 4. Include Execution Checklist
Provide a checklist Claude must complete:
```javascript
enhancedPrompt += `### EXECUTION CHECKLIST\n`;
enhancedPrompt += `**YOU MUST COMPLETE ALL OF THESE:**\n`;
enhancedPrompt += `☐ Create ${queuedAgents.length} custom agent files in .claude/agents/\n`;
enhancedPrompt += `☐ Create ${queuedRoles.length} ChatGPT role files in .chatgpt/roles/\n`;
enhancedPrompt += `☐ Update CLAUDE.md with orchestration rules\n`;
```

### 5. Specific Actions for AGENTS.md
Handle different merge scenarios explicitly:
```javascript
if (agentsMdAction === 'merge' && fs.existsSync('AGENTS.md')) {
  enhancedPrompt += `**Action: INTELLIGENT MERGE WITH EXISTING AGENTS.md**\n`;
  enhancedPrompt += `1. Read the existing AGENTS.md file\n`;
  enhancedPrompt += `2. Preserve ALL existing content\n`;
  enhancedPrompt += `3. MERGE new Memory System Navigation section\n`;
  enhancedPrompt += `6. **SAVE THE MERGED FILE to AGENTS.md**\n\n`;
}
```

## Benefits
1. **Complete File Creation**: All queued files are now created
2. **Clear Expectations**: Claude knows exactly what to create
3. **Verification Built-in**: Counts and checklists ensure completeness
4. **Better Error Detection**: Easy to see what wasn't created

## Implementation
- Updated `cli/commands/init.js` lines 147-240
- Made instructions use CAPITALS for emphasis
- Added numbered lists for each file
- Included explicit file paths
- Added verification counts and checklists

## Testing Verification
When testing, verify:
1. All custom agents are created (check count matches config)
2. All ChatGPT roles are created (check count matches config)
3. AGENTS.md is created/updated/merged as specified
4. CLAUDE.md is updated with orchestration rules
5. manifest.json and .chatgpt/AGENTS.md are created

## Success Metrics
- 100% of queued files created (not just 27%)
- CLAUDE.md properly updated
- AGENTS.md properly merged/created
- Clear verification output showing all files created
