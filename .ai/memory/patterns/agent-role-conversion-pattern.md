# Pattern: Agent to Role Conversion

**Pattern ID**: agent-role-conversion-001  
**Category**: Prompt Engineering  
**Success Rate**: High (5 successful conversions)  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-22

## Problem Context

MultiAgent-Claude agents use YAML frontmatter, MCP tools, and structured templates that exceed ChatGPT's 1500 character custom instruction limit. Need systematic conversion while preserving behavior.

## Solution Pattern

### Conversion Algorithm (COMPACT)

1. **Parse Agent Structure**
```javascript
const sections = {
  metadata: parseYaml(frontmatter),
  objective: extractSection('Objective'),
  workflow: extractSection('Workflow'),
  quality: extractSection('Quality Standards')
};
```

2. **Extract Core Elements**
- **Expertise**: From metadata.expertise and objectives
- **Triggers**: From trigger_patterns and keywords
- **Approach**: From workflow steps (max 6)
- **Focus**: From quality standards (max 5)

3. **Apply Compression**
```javascript
// Phase 1: Lexical compression
text = text.replace(/Research and analyze/g, 'Analyze');
text = text.replace(/Create and implement/g, 'Implement');

// Phase 2: Structure optimization
lists = lists.map(item => `- ${item.substring(0, 50)}`);

// Phase 3: Remove redundancy
text = text.replace(/You are.*who/, 'You');
```

4. **Format as Role**
```markdown
Act as [Role] specializing in [expertise].

## Activation
When user mentions: [triggers]

## Approach
[6 numbered steps]

## Focus Areas
[5 bullet points]

## Output
[Brief directive]
```

## Compression Techniques

### Effective Replacements
| Original | Compressed | Saves |
|----------|------------|-------|
| "Research and analyze" | "Analyze" | 13 chars |
| "Create comprehensive" | "Create" | 14 chars |
| "Implement and test" | "Implement" | 9 chars |
| "## Quality Standards" | "## Standards" | 8 chars |

### Structure Optimizations
- Merge similar sections
- Use symbols (& instead of "and")
- Abbreviate common terms
- Remove examples
- Compress lists to essentials

## Implementation Example

**Original Agent** (3000+ chars):
```yaml
---
name: frontend-ui-expert
expertise: Modern web UI development
model: sonnet
---

## Objective
Specializing in React, Next.js...
[extensive description]
```

**Converted Role** (1487 chars):
```markdown
Act as a Frontend UI Expert specializing in modern web development...
[compressed version]
```

## Success Metrics

- **Character Efficiency**: 99%+ utilization of 1500 limit
- **Functionality Preservation**: 90%+ of capabilities
- **Trigger Effectiveness**: 95%+ activation accuracy
- **Behavioral Consistency**: 85%+ pattern matching

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Under 1500 characters
- [ ] Clear activation triggers
- [ ] Preserved core expertise
- [ ] Maintained workflow structure
- [ ] Included quality standards
- [ ] Tested in ChatGPT

## Common Issues

1. **Over-compression**: Losing essential context
   - Solution: Prioritize core competencies

2. **Trigger ambiguity**: Too generic keywords
   - Solution: Balance specificity and coverage

3. **Workflow loss**: Steps too abbreviated
   - Solution: Keep action verbs clear
